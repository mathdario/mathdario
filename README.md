My name is Matheus and I have a degree in Full Stack Software Development from Cubos Academy.

Ever since I was very young, I have always been passionate about technology. I have always loved learning about how computers work. A few years ago, I was studying computer science at university, but due to some personal issues, I had to stop and couldn't finish it because of the challenges of everyday life. Several years later, a developer friend of mine introduced me to Cubos, where I became a 💻web developer. As an addition, I plan to start studying 🎮game programming only as a hobby for now.

I have knowledge in JavaScript, SQL, RESTful APIs, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Material UI, React, TypeScript, Git and Figma. I am currently focused on improving my skills in Next.js, TailwindCSS and Prisma (with future interests in Docker and OOP).

Passionate about the best web development technologies, ☕coffee and ⚔️games, I enjoy watching series and movies, as well as reading books that help me become a better person.

I am actively seeking opportunities to work as a Junior Full Stack, Backend or Frontend developer. I am excited to contribute to challenging projects and be part of an inspiring team.
